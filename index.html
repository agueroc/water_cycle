        <h1>Evaporation</h1>
        <p>Evaporation is the process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas or vapor. 
            Evaporation is the primary pathway that water moves from the liquid state back into the water cycle as atmospheric water vapor. 
            Studies have shown that the oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers provide nearly 90 percent of the moisture in the atmosphere via evaporation, 
            with the remaining 10 percent being contributed by plant transpiration.
            A very small amount of water vapor enters the atmosphere through sublimation, the process by which water changes from a solid (ice or snow) to a gas, 
            bypassing the liquid phase. This often happens in the Rocky Mountains as dry and warm Chinook winds blow in from the Pacific in late winter and early spring. 
            When a Chinook takes effect local temperatures rise dramatically in a matter of hours. When the dry air hits the snow, it changes the snow directly into water vapor,
            bypassing the liquid phase. Sublimation is a common way for snow to disappear quickly in arid climates. (Source: Mount Washington Observatory) </p>
